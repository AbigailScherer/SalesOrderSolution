Cosmic Elite Road Warrior Wheels-
Sheds weight and rolling resistance compared to the original One tire.
Long -
Given these advantages, the Pro One makes a compelling case for racing on tubeless tires,
 and we can only hope to see more race wheels offered in the future that are compatible with them.
 To improve upon an already solid tire, Schwalbe started with triple compound rubber, adding Snakebite 
 and Sidewall protection that teams with a liquid, tubeless sealant to retain air pressure over time
 and help resist punctures. The firm center strip improves the rolling resistance by a claimed ten percent 
 while softer shoulders grip the tarmac for control while cornering at high speeds. Schwalbe's MicroSkin 
 construction adds durability to the Pro One, helping the tire resist ill-intentioned debris on the roads 
 so you get through your race flat-free, while the tubeless construction allows you to race with the tires at
 lower air pressure and eliminates friction between the tube and tire that can slow you down.
